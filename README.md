Finally, I "organized" it!

## Git
The [.gitconfig](./.gitconfig) files is kind of personal and mine isn't a big deal: it enables the
colors for commands like `$ git log`. I also defined the `develop` branch as the main and I use a
commit message template defined in [.gitmessage](./.gitmessage), which was inspired in
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Nerd Fonts
A Font package that I use in Tilix and Neovim. To install or read more about see:
<https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts>.

I'm using **FireCode Nerd Font Regular** and for Arch Linux system is this
[package](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/ttf-firacode-nerd/).

## Oh My Zsh
I use `zsh` shell with [*Oh My Zsh*](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) manager. To check if you
have it installed in your linux and if it is defined as default shell, use:
```bash
# Check if is installed
$ zsh --version

# Check if it is the default shell. You should receive 'bin/szh'
$ echo $SHELL
```

The [.zshrc](./.zshrc) file was basically generated by *Oh My Zsh* installer, I only added some
plugins. To install it, execute:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

I also use the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh) theme (**it
should have *NerdFonts* installed!**). To add in your *Oh My Zsh*, execute:
```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
Also add `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in your `~/.zshrc` (in my already has it).

For the plugins, install [rvm](https://rvm.io/) and
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

## Tilix Terminal Emulator
To import my setup (**it should have *Nerd Fonts* installed!**) execute:
```bash
$ dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < tilix.dconf
```

## My Neovim like an IDE
Set of plugins and settings that I use in Neovim. To organized it (and don't let it as a giant
single file) I spread my setup in other files as you can see in [nvim/lua/user](./nvim/lua/user),
keeping [init.lua](./nvim/init.lua) simple, only to load the other configuration files.

Packages that I usually need to install for a good `:checkhealth`:
```sh
sudo pacman -S wget fd ripgrep xclip
npm install -g neovim
gem install neovim rubocop rubocop-packaging rubocop-performance rubocop-rails rubocop-rspec
```

Copy, change and use it at will. Suggestions and (polite) criticism are welcome ðŸ¤“.

**NOTE**: To use the [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) icons you need to
install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) and enable in your terminal emulator profile or if
you use Tilix you can use my settings as I explained before.

## My Zettelkasten notes
After reading about this method I realized that I got completely disorganized with my work
annotations and I found an amazing solution for use this method with Neovim thanks to
[MickaÃ«l Menu](https://github.com/mickael-menu). You can read more about this here:
<https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk>.

This is also a good excuse to practice my English writing some kind of personal journal, like my
daily routine, and this note-talking assistant can be configured for this propose too as they
describe in their documentation: <https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk/blob/main/docs/daily-journal.md>.

This also is a personal stuff, I use a collection of groups in my [zk config file](./zk/config.toml)
that attend my needs, for example. I strongly recommend you to watch this video <https://youtu.be/UzhZb7e4l4Y>,
which was a good guide for me, be sides
[the documentation of zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md),
of course.

On Arch Linux the following packages are required:
```sh
sudo pacman -S zk fzf bat
```

## Clipboard on Windows WSL

To able clipboard on Windows WSL you need [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank). Download the
.exe file and do the following:

```sh
sudo cp ~/Downloads/win32yank.exe /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/win32yank.exe
```

## My symbolic links

```sh
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshenv ~/.zshenv
ln -s ~/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/dotfiles/zk ~/my-zk/.zk
ln -s ~/dotfiles/zk ~/.config/zk
```
