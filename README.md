Finally I "organized" it!

## Git
The [.gitconfig](./.gitconfig) files is kind a personal and mine isn't a big deal: it enables the
colors for commands like `$ git log`, I also define the `develop` branch as the main and I use a
commit message template defined in [.gitmessage](./.gitmessage), which was inspired in
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Nerd Fonts
A Font package that I use in Tilix and Neovim. To install or read more about access:
<https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts>.

## Oh My Zsh
I use `zsh` shell with [*Oh My Zsh*](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) manager. To check if you
have it installed in your linux and if it is defined as default shell, use:
```bash
# Check if is installed
$ zsh --version

# Check if it is the default shell. You should recive 'bin/szh'
$ echo $SHELL
```

The [.zshrc](./.zshrc) file was basically generated by *Oh My Zsh* installer, I only added some
plugins. To install it, execute:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

I also use the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh) theme (**should
have *NerdFonts* installed!**). To add in your *Oh My Zsh*, execute:
```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
Also add `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in your `~/.zshrc`.


## Tilix Terminal Emulator
To import my setup (**should have *Nerd Fonts* installed!**) execute:
```bash
$ dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < tilix.dconf
```

## My Neovim like an IDE
Set of plugins and settings that I use in Neovim. To organized it (and don't let it as a giant
single file) I spred my setup in other files as you can see in [nvim/lua/user](./nvim/lua/user),
keeping [init.lua](./nvim/init.lua) simple, only to load the other configuration files.

Copy, change and use at will. Suggestions and (polite) criticism are welcome ðŸ¤“.

**NOTE**: To use the [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) icons you need to
install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) and enable in your terminal emulator profile or if
you use Tilix you can use my settings as I explained before.
